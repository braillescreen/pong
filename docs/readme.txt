Pong
thanks to NS Studios for helping with sounds for the game and for saving and loading a game.
here are basic instructions to get you going quickly
firstly, when you start the game, click set default character
Select one with left and right arrows and hit enter.
You will only have to do this one time unless you lose your data folder.
Now, you click play.
Here is how it works. you are on a 2d grid, you are on one end and your oponent is on the other end. your goal is to hit the ball back and forth to each other, and if in normal mode, with a few twists. Classic mode will not have these features, it's just normal pong.
The ball can move left and right
the ball can become invisible.
you or your oponent can get shields
and a few more things.
how to move.
hit left and right arrows to move left and right. you will hear step sounds to indicate this. if you are at the left or right edges, you hear another boundary sound.
To serve or receive the ball, hit up arrow.
when the ball is hit back to you, you hear so by a whack sound and then the ball begins to get louder. move closer with left and right, and hit up arrow to receive the ball.
the ball goes back for the oponent to receive and so on.
invisiballs.
invisiballs happen at random. When an invisiball occurs, the ball goes invisible, meaning you can't hear it. you can only hear it hit walls. So, you have to either:
A. hit it back to the oponent, or
B. Miss it entirely.
Shields
Shields happen randomly also. when a shield occurs, you hear a woosh sound, then a constant hum. The shield protects you from balls that you miss. But the catch is, you only get it for 30 seconds, at which time the hum stops, and a woosh is heard.

note: When you test speakers or win or lose a game, you can press space or enter to skip those sounds.
this game is pretty fun for people who wanted something similar to dragon pong but for offline use. Enjoy.
