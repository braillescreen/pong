New in 4.0 Pre7
If an invisiball hits a shield, it no longer reappears.
AI no longer knows where the invisiball is. Instead, he runs around frantically and if he hits it, it's by chance.
Hopefully fixes a bug in which the AI loses and then gets stuck trying to serve.
Decreases ball's maximum speed, making the game a bit more possible later on in the match.
Slows down computer a bit, making it so hopefully he'll lose a bit more likely.
Adds autopilot!
Fixes a bug which would cause the ball to fly off the board in some cases, rendering the rest of that game completely unplayable, as amusing as that was sometimes. This usually happened when an AI had a shield and the ball hit the shield and then the AI managed to hit it, causing it to somehow go back in the other direction. Yeah that was broken.
Adds remaining difficulty levels from SWPong 3.2.
Fixes a problem where on some machines, the game would run at a very low frame rate and cause huge CPU usage

for sure, fixed the ball getting stuck bug.
changed it so the ball's pitch is lower when your oponent is getting the ball, and it's higher when you are getting the ball. So, like if you just hit the ball, the pitch would lower. Then, he hits, and the pitch gets higher so you know to serve.
fixed a whole bunch of bugs with resetting the game. This will make the gameplay a lot nicer in between games.
fixed that if the oponent's shield gets hit, the ball would not return.
